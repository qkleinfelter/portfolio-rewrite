Air-3550 is an Airline ticketing system built in C# as the final project for
my Software Engineering course at the University of Toledo during the Spring
2021 semester. The project was built entirely in C#, with a WinUI frontend and
an Entity Framework Core based backend. This project also used a SQLite database
that is automatically generated and seeded as part of the application to ensure
that everything within the application is easily replicable and gradeable.

For more information about this application and project, as well as to see it in action,
please check out this YouTube video my team and I recorded for the project.
