FxTwitter Link Rewrite is a simple Firefox extension I built because I got annoyed
with Twitter & X links not unfurling correctly in other services like Discord.
Luckily I found out about [FixupX](https://github.com/FixTweet/FxTwitter) which will allow these links to unfurl correctly again. This extension replaces
links you copy via the built in share button in twitter to use FixupX and make better links.
This [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxtwitter-link-rewrite/) is available for Firefox for Desktop and for Android!
